Doorcard creation system for California State University Sacramento Department of Computer Science

This system was designed and built by Team Inlustris for Senior Project for use in the Department of Computer Science to generate the schedules of professors to then be printed out and pasted to their office door.

The system is Java-based, with an accompanying website and database. The Java-based tool contains 3 functions:

1. Creating an Excel spreadsheet containing the doorcards (which can then be printed for use by the department) based on information pulled from the database
2. Reading and updating course information in the database from an Excel spreadsheet (downloaded from the existing school system)
3. Deleting existing course information from the database
